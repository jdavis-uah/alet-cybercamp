"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds.

Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds.

Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923.

Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.

"The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server. 
 
Some clients may currently be relying on unsigned SASL binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, and will stop working if this configuration change is made.  To assist in identifying these clients, if such binds occur this directory server will log a summary event once every 24 hours indicating how many such binds occurred.  You are encouraged to configure those clients to not use such binds.  Once no such events are observed for an extended period, it is recommended that you configure the server to reject such binds. 
 
For more details and information on how to make this configuration change to the server, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=87923. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.
